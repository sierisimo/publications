# My favorite computer theory to create examples

In university I learned a lot of different stuff but one of my favorite assignment in the "_Computer Theory_" class was **URM** (Unlimited Register Machine).

## The theory

**URM** serves to demonstrate some concepts about computers and the _computability_ of some operations. I won't get very into details of the history or theory, but it's similar to the theory of [Turin machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) that given a set of ordered instructions on a tape (called algorithm) the machine is capable of simulate that algorithm.

## The registers

The registers in URM works similar to an infinite sequential cells enumerated by position. You can put just numbers in there. The preconditions or information about this registers depends mostly on the author, but most agree that if the register hasn't been touch it contains empty data. Other authors prefer to just go and say every register contains a zero before being touched by the machine.

## The operations

To obtain a result of a computable algorithm (or demonstrate it's computable) **URM** provides us with 3 basic operations, some books or authors mention a fourth operation but the fourth operations I have seen on paper are achievable with just the 3 basics (names or letters may vary depending on the author):

* `Z(position)` Zero operation. Replaces whatever is in the register at `position` with a 0
* `I(position)` Increment operation.  Adds 1 to whatever is on the register at `position`. If we are strictâ€¦ if nothing is at the register it cannot add 1 to it (so you need to invoke `Z(position)` first).
* `J(positionX, positionY, instruction)` Jump operation. Compares the value of register at `positionX` and `positionY,` when the value is the same continues the execution at `instruction`. Is valid to send a `instruction` out of range, this will indicate the immediate end of the execution

## The Instructions

This also varies from author to author but the idea is the same: You have an ordered and identified list of calls for operations on registers representing your algorithm, once the list ends, URM will stop.

Using a generic notation (there is not a formal or standard one), the list will look like:

```
1:  Z(5)
2:  I(5)
3:  Z(2)
4:  J(2, 5, 7)
5:  I(5)
6:  I(2)
7:  J(2, 2, 6)
```

## The preconditions

There's also possible to provide preconditions to the machine to indicate a set of previously filled data or how the algorithm work using variables (all lowercase):

```
X: [2,,,3] 
```

Will indicate that the registers at position 0 and 3 started with a value. URM will proceed to read the instructions with this assumption and give a result.

or

```
X: [x,y]
```

Will indicate the existence of unknown numbers with names `x` and `y` . This will later execute with real values, the concept of variable does not exist on URM.

## The result

There's no formal indication on where the result will be. On class we created a small set of instructions to copy the result to the register at position 0. In that way you can check for a specific result in that position.

## Example: Copy function

A set of instructions with the precondition of having a single number at register 1 and copying the value to the register 0

```
X: [,y]

1: J(0, 1, 6)
2: Z(0)
3: J(0, 1, 6)
4: I(0)
5: J(0, 0, 3)
```

You can then use this to invoke as new operations (you will end up writing something similar but with different registers).

[I wrote a small implementation of URM in JavaScript](https://github.com/sierisimo/URMjs/) running with node if you're interested in give it a check. Is code from when I was at university but still works (it has almost no dependencies).

This is something I wanted to share (and something I'll use for later examples) and hope gives you the same amount of fun it gave me. It's fun to program this as an exercise. I recommend you to give it a try (I know I will in Kotlin).
